## Interview Talking Points

**What to emphasize about your Anthropic knowledge:**

1. "I've read about Constitutional AI - the idea of building safety in rather than bolting it on resonates with how I've had to build for regulated industries."

2. "Claude's reasoning capabilities are what drew us to it for mortgage underwriting. When you're making credit decisions, you need a model that can explain its thinking."

3. "The 200K context window matters for enterprise use cases - we needed to process entire loan applications, not just snippets."

4. "I noticed Anthropic is SOC 2 Type II certified - that's table stakes for financial services, and it shows you're serious about enterprise."
