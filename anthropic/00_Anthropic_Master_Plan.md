# Anthropic Preparation - Master Plan

## Your Fit Summary

**Why you're a strong candidate:**
1. **Built production AI on Claude** - Not just talked about it, shipped it ($700M mortgages, 32 banks)
2. **Enterprise GTM track record** - Google ($4Bn portfolio), AWS ($75M deals), 100%+ quota for 16 quarters
3. **Regulated industries experience** - Banking, fintech = understands compliance, explainability, AI safety
4. **APAC market expertise** - Anthropic is expanding globally, you know the region deeply
5. **Rare combination** - Technical enough to talk architecture, commercial enough to close deals

**Your differentiator:**
> "I've built AI products AND sold AI to enterprises. Most people have done one or the other."

## Phase 3: Networking (Week 2-3)

### Warm Connections
- [ ] Google colleagues now at Anthropic
- [ ] AWS colleagues in AI/ML
- [ ] Investors who know Anthropic team
- [ ] Fintech founders using Claude

### Cold Outreach Targets
- [ ] Anthropic GTM leadership (LinkedIn)
- [ ] Anthropic APAC team (if exists)

### Referral Ask Template
```
I'm exploring GTM roles at Anthropic. I've spent the last 3 years building
production AI on Claude (fintech, $700M mortgages, 32 banks) and have
18 years enterprise GTM (Google, AWS). Would you be open to connecting
me with the right person on the team?

## Phase 4: Interview Prep (Ongoing)

### Anthropic-Specific Questions

**"Why Anthropic?"**
> Three reasons. First, I've built on Claude - at Ringkas we evaluated all
> foundation models and Claude was meaningfully better at reasoning through
> complex financial documents. I've seen the quality difference firsthand.
>
> Second, safety alignment. I've built AI for regulated industries where
> explainability and guardrails aren't optional. Anthropic's approach to
> Constitutional AI and responsible development aligns with how I've had to build.
>
> Third, timing. Enterprise AI adoption is just starting. I want to help
> write the GTM playbook, not follow someone else's.

**"What do you know about our safety work?"**
> I know the practitioner side - building guardrails, bias detection, audit
> trails for banking. I'm genuinely interested in how Anthropic thinks about
> these problems at the foundation model level. Constitutional AI is trying
> to build safety in rather than bolt it on. I'd want to learn how that
> translates to enterprise deployment.

**"How would you sell Claude to enterprises?"**
> Start with use cases where reasoning matters - document analysis, complex
> workflows, regulated industries. Don't compete on price or speed, compete
> on quality and reliability. Land with a specific use case, expand to platform.
> I'd build a playbook similar to what I did at Google - TCO comparisons,
> POC methodology, competitive displacement framework.

**"What's your view on AI pricing?"**
> Enterprise buyers want predictability. The winning model is probably committed
> spend with usage flexibility - like AWS EDPs. At Ringkas we charge per mortgage
> originated, not per API call. Align pricing with customer outcomes.

### Technical Depth
Be ready to explain:
- Ringkas agent architecture (supervisor + 4 specialized agents)
- Why you chose Claude over GPT-4 for certain tasks
- LangGraph orchestration
- Guardrails implementation
- Eval methodology

## Phase 5: Application Strategy

### Approach Options

**Option A: Direct Application**
- Apply to posted roles
- Follow up with recruiter via LinkedIn
- Pros: Simple
- Cons: May get lost in volume

**Option B: Referral First**
- Get warm intro before applying
- Pros: 10x more likely to get interview
- Cons: Takes more time

**Option C: Executive Outreach**
- Reach out to GTM leadership directly with value proposition
- Pros: Stand out, may surface unlisted roles
- Cons: Higher risk if poorly executed

**Recommended: Option B → Option C**
Start with referrals. If no response in 2 weeks, try direct executive outreach.

## Key Messages to Land

1. **"I chose Claude"** - You evaluated all models and picked Claude for Ringkas. This is powerful.

2. **"I've shipped production AI"** - Not a talker, a builder. $700M in mortgages proves it.

3. **"I understand regulated industries"** - Banking = compliance, audits, explainability. You've done it.

4. **"I know how to scale GTM"** - Google partner program (21 resellers), India market (0→15 clients).

5. **"I'm flexible on level"** - OK with IC or manager, L6 or above. Mission matters more.
