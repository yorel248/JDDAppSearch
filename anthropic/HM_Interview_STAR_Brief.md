## STAR STORY 1: Complex Enterprise Deal
**When she asks:** "Walk me through a complex deal" / "Tell me about your biggest win"

### $75M AWS EDP — Gojek (Competitive Displacement)

**Situation:** Gojek was Indonesia's largest super-app — ride-hailing, payments, food delivery — and running entirely on GCP. AWS wanted to win the account. It was the most competitive deal in Southeast Asia.

**Task:** Displace GCP and secure a multi-year enterprise commitment. I was 6 months into the role and this was the anchor deal for the country.

**Action:**
1. **Mapped the org** — CTO, CFO, VP Engineering, procurement. Identified that engineering loved GCP but CFO was concerned about cost predictability at their growth rate.
2. **Found the wedge** — ML workloads. Gojek was investing heavily in fraud detection and demand forecasting. SageMaker was materially better than GCP's ML tools at the time. I brought in AWS ML specialists to run a 4-week proof-of-concept.
3. **Structured for the CFO** — Designed a 5-year EDP with committed spend that gave cost certainty at scale, with flexibility to shift workloads. This addressed the CFO's concern directly.
4. **De-risked migration** — Proposed a hybrid approach. Start ML workloads on AWS, keep core infrastructure on GCP initially. Reduced the "all-or-nothing" fear.

**Result:** $75M five-year EDP — largest multi-year deal in APAC. Gojek became a reference customer. Account grew to $50M P&L under my management.

**Follow-up answers ready:**
- *"Who was your champion?"* — VP Engineering who ran the ML team. He saw the SageMaker POC results and became internal advocate.
- *"How long was the cycle?"* — 9 months from first meeting to signature.
- *"Biggest objection?"* — Engineering team loyalty to GCP. We didn't fight it — we found the workloads where AWS was stronger and started there.

## STAR STORY 2: Building a Market from Zero
**When she asks:** "How would you build the Industries business?" / "Tell me about building something from scratch"

### Google Analytics 360 — ANZ → APAC Market Build

**Situation:** In 2014, Google Analytics 360 had 3 direct accounts in Australia, zero resellers, and zero presence in the rest of APAC. Adobe owned the enterprise analytics market with a 5+ year head start. I was the first on-the-ground Analytics hire in Australia after my manager.

**Task:** Build an enterprise customer base from nothing in a market where Adobe was entrenched.

**Action:**
1. **Lighthouse strategy** — I didn't try to win 50 accounts. I identified 3 marquee logos that would validate GA360 for the entire market: Telstra, Westpac, and Fairfax Media. Winning them would signal credibility.
2. **Sold Westpac in week one** — Within my first week in-country, I sold GA360 to Westpac, then followed with one of APAC's largest telcos, displacing Adobe and Salesforce. Built a TCO model showing GA360 + BigQuery was 40% cheaper over 3 years.
3. **Built the partner channel** — Recruited and certified 21 resellers across AU/NZ/SEA/India from zero. Onboarded first-ever resellers in Philippines, Thailand, and multiple Indian markets. Coached partners on platform sales and competitive selling until one could close 5 deals independently.
4. **Scaled to APAC** — After proving ANZ, I relocated to Singapore and replicated the playbook across SEA and India. Grew India from zero to 31 clients in under a year. Opened every market in SEA — Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines — each live with clients and resellers.
5. **Executive workshops at scale** — Ran 25+ events and 15+ C-level workshops including Unilever (reverse mentoring with CMO), Singapore Government (scored 4.68/5 vs Facebook's 4.32/5), DBS Bank, Bank Mandiri, and Garuda Indonesia. Touched 3,000+ senior executives across the region.

**Result:** Closed 110 deals total — 46% of the entire APAC GA360 team's output. Hit at least 100% quota every quarter from Q1 2014 through Q3 2016 (specific attainments: 101%, 103%, 102%, 108%). Built the portfolio to $4B revenue under management. The competitive playbook was adopted across APAC and contributed to $50M+ in wins. Promoted to Sales Manager II with a 46.6% salary increase.

**Follow-up answers ready:**
- *"How did your manager describe your performance?"* — My manager Martin Bertilsson wrote: "I regard Leroy as one of the crucial players in the overall team. As a sales professional he is very very strong." And: "He owns his business — proactively works out a plan for how to get there and executes it with autonomy."
- *"How did you manage handovers when scaling?"* — My manager called my ANZ-to-Singapore transition "one of the best I have seen — pipeline well documented, personal meetings where needed, full briefs to the successor. A big reason the whole pipeline closed."
- *"What about competitive displacement?"* — I competitively sold against Adobe on their top accounts: Westpac, Coles, Vodafone, Nestle. I'd map renewal timing, build the TCO case, and run POCs during evaluation windows.

**How this applies to Anthropic Industries AE:**
"I'd run the same playbook. CommBank is already your lighthouse in banking — they've cut scam losses 50% using Claude. I'd leverage that reference to open Westpac, NAB, ANZ. Then target one healthcare and one manufacturing lighthouse. Three marquee logos across industries would unlock the market."

## STAR STORY 3: Competitive Displacement
**When she asks:** "Tell me about a competitive win" / "How do you displace incumbents?"

### India Banks — Displacing Adobe at HDFC, Axis, ICICI

**Situation:** India's top 3 private banks — HDFC, Axis Bank, ICICI — were all locked into Adobe Analytics contracts. Adobe had a 5-year head start and strong penetration in Indian BFSI. Nobody at Google had cracked Indian banking.

**Task:** Win at least one to prove GA360 could compete in Indian financial services.

**Action:**
1. **Timed the approach** — Mapped all three banks' contract renewal dates. Started conversations 6 months before each renewal, when they were evaluating options.
2. **Built the business case** — Created a TCO comparison: GA360 + BigQuery was 40% cheaper over 3 years and provided real-time data access that Adobe's batch processing couldn't match.
3. **Proved it with POCs** — Ran proof-of-concepts at each bank during their evaluation window. Showed them customer journey insights they couldn't get with Adobe — cross-channel attribution that connected web, mobile app, and branch interactions.
4. **Scaled the playbook in banking** — After winning the top 3, created a "how to win banking" competitive playbook that I presented to the India BFSI sales pod alongside resellers and agencies. This accelerated adoption across the Indian financial sector and longer-term bets with State Bank of India.

**Result:** Won all three. My Google performance review documented it: "This is a first globally where we've managed to lock down banking where traditionally our competition is strong." The playbook — TCO + POC + timing — was adopted across APAC and contributed to $50M+ in competitive wins. India grew from zero to 20 accounts in under a year — half of Australia's total, built in a fraction of the time.

**Follow-up answers ready:**
- *"How did you handle the technical objections?"* — Banks in India had complex requirements around offline data integration and cross-channel measurement. I ran whiteboard sessions with CTOs to show how GA360 + BigQuery + DoubleClick connected online and offline data — something Adobe couldn't match at the time.
- *"Did you use partners?"* — Built a reseller network of 4 partners in India and ran co-pitch sessions. Also onboarded Accenture and Cognizant for longer-term scale.

**Relevance to Anthropic:** "Most enterprises already have OpenAI pilots. I'd run the same approach: time the evaluation, build the business case on quality and TCO, and prove it with a head-to-head POC on their specific use case. Let Claude's output speak for itself."

## STAR STORY 4: Failure / Learning
**When she asks:** "Tell me about a time something didn't work" / "Tell me about a failure"

### CT Corp — E-commerce Platform Launch

**Situation:** As President Director at CT Corp Digital, we launched Transmart's e-commerce platform to compete with Tokopedia and Shopee in Indonesia.

**Task:** Build a digital commerce business for Indonesia's 3rd largest conglomerate.

**Action:** We built the platform, integrated it with 100+ physical stores, invested in customer acquisition and logistics. Ambitious launch across multiple categories.

**Result (the failure):** We underestimated the capital required. Tokopedia and Shopee were burning $100M+ per year on customer acquisition. We couldn't match that with a conglomerate's budget cycle.

**What I learned:**
1. **Don't fight incumbents on their strength.** They had funding and network effects. We had physical stores. We should have led with our asymmetric advantage from day one.
2. **Pivot fast.** We shifted to omnichannel — click-and-collect, same-day delivery from stores — which played to our retail footprint. That worked.
3. **Applied to Ringkas:** When I started Ringkas, I specifically chose mortgage infrastructure because there was no dominant player. I always ask now: "What's our unfair advantage?"

---

## STAR STORY 5: Consumption / AI Sales
**When she asks:** "How do you think about selling consumption-based AI?" / "How would you sell Claude?"

### AWS EDP + Ringkas Pricing Model (Combined)

**Situation:** At AWS, I sold consumption-based cloud services to digital natives. At Ringkas, I had to price an AI product for banks — two very different contexts but the same core challenge: customers want predictability, usage models create uncertainty.

**Task:** Structure deals that give enterprise buyers cost certainty while preserving usage-based economics.

**Action:**
1. **At AWS:** Designed EDPs (Enterprise Discount Programs) — committed annual spend with usage flexibility underneath. CFOs got a predictable number. Engineering got freedom to shift workloads. I closed $75M using this structure.
2. **At Ringkas:** We charge per mortgage originated, not per API call. Banks only pay when they make money. This aligned our pricing with their outcome and made procurement straightforward.
3. **Key principle:** Enterprise buyers don't buy tokens. They buy outcomes. The pricing model has to translate technical consumption into business value.

**How I'd apply this at Anthropic:**
"Lead with bounded use cases — document processing, customer service automation — where you can estimate token usage and show clear ROI. Start with committed spend agreements. Once they see value, expand. Don't try to sell 'deploy Claude everywhere' on day one."

---

## STAR STORY 6: Why Leave Ringkas / Why This Role
**When she asks:** "You founded a company. Why leave?" / "Can you work in a structured environment?"

**Situation:** Ringkas is in a stable position — $11.5M raised, 32 bank partnerships, $700M in annual mortgage origination, strong management team running operations. We're expanding to the Middle East with local leadership.

**Task:** Decide whether to stay and scale or find the next thing I'm best suited for.

**Action / Decision:**
"I built what I set out to build — proved that AI can transform mortgage lending in Asia. The company doesn't need me in the weeds anymore.

On the personal side, I relocated back to Sydney. My daughter is starting school, my parents are getting older. The timing was right.

What excites me about this role: it's a founding AE position, building from scratch. That's what I'm best at — I did it at Google for ANZ, at CT Corp for digital, at Ringkas from zero. I'm not looking for a comfortable job. I'm looking to build."

**If she probes "can you work in structure":**
"I built structure at Ringkas — OKRs, reporting lines, decision rights. I've also thrived at Google and AWS. The founder experience taught me what I'm good at: building GTM and closing enterprise deals. I don't need to be the CEO to do that."

---

## STAR STORY 7: Selling a Vision / Category Creation
**When she asks:** "Tell me about a time you had to convince skeptics" / "How do you sell something nobody understands?" / "Tell me about creating a new category"

### Ringkas — Building an AI Mortgage Platform When Nobody Understood the Space

**Situation:** In 2022, mortgage lending in Southeast Asia was completely broken. Banks processed applications manually — paper forms, 2-week turnaround, 70% rejection rates. Nobody was building digital infrastructure for this. Investors didn't understand the category. Banks were skeptical of tech startups touching their lending process.

**Task:** Build a company from zero in a category that didn't exist, convince banks and property developers to adopt it, and raise capital in a market where nobody understood the opportunity.

**Action (three phases):**

**Phase 1 — Anchor client to prove demand:**
- I couldn't sell to banks without proof that developers needed this. So I started with property developers.
- Pitched Ciputra Group (Indonesia's #1 residential developer): "Your buyers drop off because bank approvals take 2 weeks and rejection rates are 30%+. We pre-qualify buyers in real-time — you see which customers can afford what, upsell or downsell them to the right unit, and screen them before sending to banks. Faster turnover, fewer rejected units."
- Ciputra signed an exclusive agreement — all mortgage customers across all their projects channeled through Ringkas. Then Sinar Mas Land (#2 developer) followed. Having Indonesia's two biggest developers gave us leverage with the banks — their customers were already on our platform.

**Phase 2 — Lock in banks with the right platform strategy:**
- Our competitor Ideal raised capital and entered the market, but they focused on building a consumer app. We took the opposite approach — worked backwards from the bank.
- We built end-to-end infrastructure: digital submission, eKYC, automated credit analysis, document verification, capacity checking, risk scoring — for both the property developer AND the bank. Banks received applications directly into their systems in their own format, ready to process. Not just a front-end — the full pipeline.
- This meant banks had to integrate deeply. Once integrated across 1,300+ branches in 47+ cities, switching cost was enormous. We locked in 32 banks covering 98% of the lending market — MUFG, OCBC, UOB, Woori Bank, Mandiri, BCA.

**Phase 3 — Raise capital and outrun the competition:**
- First pre-seed of $2M from 500 Global, East Ventures, Sequoia Scout, Woori Bank, Flourish Ventures. Angel SPV included 6 unicorn founders.
- Used that to secure the OJK aggregator license (only 6 ever granted — we're the only one for mortgages), ISO 27001 certification, and pass cybersecurity penetration testing. These compliance barriers took 6-12 months and most competitors didn't have the patience or capital to clear.
- Ideal couldn't onboard banks because they hadn't built the back-end integration. They went out of business. We raised to $11.5M total across 3 rounds (latest: $5.1M Pre-Series A, Feb 2025).

**Result:** $700M annualized mortgage origination (7x growth). 32 banks, 1,300+ branches, 47 cities, 4,500+ bank employees on platform. 10,000 active users logging in regularly. Processing time from 6-8 weeks to under 1 week. 96% of customers are first-time home buyers. The only OJK-licensed mortgage aggregator in the market. Expanding to Saudi Arabia (partnered with Roshn, PIF-backed developer building 400K homes) and Malaysia.

**Follow-up answers ready:**
- *"How long from founding to first bank live?"* — About 8 months. First 3-4 months building platform + getting Ciputra. Next 4 months bank integration and OJK licensing. Full operations allowed after regulatory sandbox license in early 2023.
- *"Why did Ideal fail?"* — They built for consumers, we built for the ecosystem. A consumer app without bank integrations is a dead end. We solved the hard problem first — the bank-side infrastructure.
- *"What was the hardest part?"* — Convincing the first bank. Banks are risk-averse by nature. Having Ciputra and Sinar Mas as anchor clients was the unlock — the bank's customers were already on our platform. Once the first few banks saw volume flowing through, the rest followed.
- *"How do you monetize?"* — Commission-based: 0.5% on primary mortgages, 1% on refinance/home equity (BTN pays a tiered additional 0.35%, so up to 1.5% max). Plus platform fees (AI packages $350-$5,000/month) and API pre-qualification fees ($3/call for eKYC + credit check). Bank Mandiri (largest govt bank, 3,000+ branches) pays 1% on every approved loan to use our infrastructure for their own origination — and gives borrowers a 0.5% interest rate discount for using the platform. Insurance cross-sell starting with Tokio Marine and Ciputra Life — 30-36% commission on premiums (life insurance is mandatory for every mortgage).
- *"What's the social impact?"* — First year of operations: 2,236 loans facilitated, 96% first-time home buyers, average interest rate 4.7%, 93% customer satisfaction (vs 87% industry benchmark). Average loan size $81K. Most customers earn under $1K/month. We're democratising home ownership for middle-class Indonesia.

**Relevance to Anthropic:**
"This is exactly the challenge for Industries AE. Enterprises in banking, healthcare, manufacturing are skeptical of AI. You need an anchor reference — CommBank is that for banking. Then you build outward. And you win by solving the hard integration problems, not just building a nice demo."

---

## STAR STORY 8: Competitive Strategy / Building a Moat
**When she asks:** "How do you handle competition?" / "Tell me about outmaneuvering a competitor" / "How do you build defensibility?"

### Ringkas vs Ideal — Locking Up the Market

**Situation:** After we raised our pre-seed and started gaining traction, a competitor called Ideal entered the market with funding and a similar thesis — digitize mortgage lending in Indonesia.

**Task:** Defend our position and win the market before a funded competitor could catch up.

**Action:**
1. **Diagnosed their weakness** — Ideal built a consumer-facing app (borrower submits application, sees status). Looks good in a pitch deck. But they hadn't solved the hard problem: back-end integration with bank credit systems. Their platform was a wrapper, not infrastructure.
2. **Doubled down on the moat** — We focused all engineering on bank-side integrations. Each bank has different credit criteria, different document requirements, different risk models. We parameterized our platform to handle all of them. This was 6-12 months of unglamorous work, but it created switching cost.
3. **Locked in supply** — Signed partnership agreements with all major banks. Once a bank is integrated and processing loans on your platform, they don't want to integrate with a second platform for the same thing. We made it operationally painful to switch.
4. **Compliance as a moat** — Got the OJK aggregator license and ISO 27001 before anyone else. In regulated industries, compliance isn't overhead — it's a barrier to entry. Ideal didn't have the license when banks started asking for it.

**Result:** Ideal went out of business. We had all 32 banks (98% of the lending market) locked on our platform, the only OJK-licensed mortgage aggregator, exclusive agreements with the two largest property developers, embedded in two of Indonesia's largest e-wallets (OVO/Grab and Dana/Alipay — 100M+ users each), and a partnership with Century 21. No new competitor has entered since. Even banks started using our platform for their own origination — Mandiri (largest govt bank, 3,000+ branches) adopted it across their branch network.

**Relevance to Anthropic:**
"In enterprise AI, the moat isn't the model — it's the integration depth. Whoever gets embedded into the customer's workflow first wins. My approach for Industries would be the same: don't just sell Claude as an API — help customers integrate it into their core processes so deeply that switching becomes operationally painful."

## STAR STORY 9: Navigating Regulated Industries / Compliance
**When she asks:** "How do you sell into regulated industries?" / "Tell me about navigating compliance" / "How do you work with banks?"

### Ringkas — Getting Licensed and Bank-Certified in Indonesia

**Situation:** To operate as a mortgage aggregator in Indonesia, we needed approval from OJK (the Financial Services Authority), ISO 27001 certification, and to pass cybersecurity penetration testing. Banks wouldn't integrate with us without these. No shortcuts.

**Task:** Get fully licensed and certified while simultaneously building the product and onboarding clients. We couldn't wait — every month of delay was a month a competitor could catch up.

**Action:**
1. **Parallel-tracked everything** — Didn't wait for licensing before building. Started OJK application in month 1 while building the platform. Ran ISO 27001 prep alongside bank integration work.
2. **Hired compliance early** — Brought in a regulatory affairs lead from banking in month 2. Most startups treat compliance as an afterthought. We treated it as a product feature.
3. **Built for auditability** — Every AI decision logged with reasoning. Bias monitoring on approval rates. Human escalation paths for edge cases. These weren't just regulatory requirements — they made banks trust us.
4. **Used compliance as a sales tool** — In bank pitches, we led with our license and certifications. "We're the only OJK-licensed aggregator with ISO 27001" immediately differentiated us from competitors who were pitching without credentials.

**Result:** OJK aggregator license secured. ISO 27001 certified. Passed all cybersecurity testing. 32 banks integrated. Compliance became our competitive advantage, not our bottleneck.

**Relevance to Anthropic:**
"Industries AE means banks, healthcare, manufacturing — all regulated. I know how to navigate this. Anthropic already has SOC 2 Type II and strong data handling. For industries customers, I'd lead with safety, compliance, and auditability as differentiators — not afterthoughts. That's how Claude wins against OpenAI in regulated sectors."

## STAR STORY 10: Cross-Platform Selling / Expanding the Footprint
**When she asks:** "How do you expand within an account?" / "Tell me about land and expand" / "How do you drive consumption growth?"

### Google — Traveloka Cross-Sell (GA360 → Cloud → Full Data Stack Migration)

**Situation:** Traveloka, one of Indonesia's largest travel platforms, was a GA360 customer. They were running their data infrastructure on AWS Redshift with zero spend on Google Cloud. Six months ago, GCP wasn't even in the picture.

**Task:** Expand the GA360 engagement into a broader platform relationship — drive additional revenue across Google Cloud products by connecting the analytics footprint to data infrastructure.

**Action:**
1. **Identified the adjacent opportunity** — During GA360 workshops with Traveloka, I spotted that their analytics team was pulling GA360 data into AWS Redshift for analysis. That's an inefficient workflow — BigQuery was a natural fit since it integrates natively with GA360.
2. **Brought in Cloud** — Proactively shared my GA360 customer list with the GCP team so we could account-map and cross-sell. Introduced the GCP account manager (Zaakir Khan) directly to Traveloka's CMO.
3. **Ran joint workshops** — Hosted multi-day data and analytics workshops involving GA360, DoubleClick, and Cloud teams. Demonstrated BigQuery Data Transfer Service to show a holistic view of consumer behaviour — something Redshift couldn't do natively with GA360 data.
4. **Earned the CMO's trust** — Through repeated engagement and proving value, we earned the CMO's confidence. The analytics play became the wedge for a full infrastructure conversation.

**Result:** Traveloka migrated their entire data stack from AWS Redshift to Google Cloud Platform. What started as a GA360 analytics license turned into a multi-product relationship across GA360, DoubleClick, BigQuery, and Cloud Pub/Sub. My Cloud colleague wrote: "Traveloka was not spending on GCP 6 months ago. With Leroy's support they are in the process of migrating their entire data stack to GCP."

**Relevance to Anthropic:**
"This is the consumption growth story. Start with a bounded Claude use case — document processing, customer service — prove value, then expand into adjacent workflows. At Anthropic, the path is: API license → deeper integration → more use cases → committed spend. I've run this exact motion at Google and it's the same playbook for consumption-based AI."

## STAR STORY 11: Consultative Selling / Earning Customer Trust
**When she asks:** "How do you build trust with customers?" / "Tell me about your sales approach" / "What's your selling style?"

### Google — Knowing When Not to Sell (OzForex Example)

**Situation:** OzForex (now OFX), a major Australian foreign exchange company, wanted to align their CRM data with online analytics data. My LCS colleague Dan Metcalf brought me in to assess whether GA Premium was the right solution.

**Task:** Evaluate the client's needs and recommend the right solution — even if it wasn't our premium product.

**Action:**
1. **Led with discovery, not a pitch** — Put the pitch deck aside. Asked about their current capabilities, where they saw themselves in 12 months, what they'd already tried.
2. **Gave an honest assessment** — After appraising the conversation, I told them they weren't ready for GA Premium. Universal Analytics with a third-party integration partner could meet their current requirements — with a path to Premium in the mid-term.
3. **Played the long game** — This wasn't about losing a deal. It was about positioning Google as a trusted advisor. OzForex would come back when they were ready — and they'd remember we didn't oversell.

**Result:** My peer Dan Metcalf documented this in my performance review: "The client was genuinely appreciative that Leroy didn't attempt to sell them a solution from which they would not have benefitted in the short term. It is this type of consultancy that brings us within the sphere of the client's trust." This approach became a pattern — my peer Matt Batcheldor noted: "Not everyone has a subtle sales ability to market a product without being overly sales-like. A truly effective communicator — which is how we sell at Google."

**Relevance to Anthropic:**
"In Industries, trust is everything. Banks and healthcare companies are risk-averse. If I push Claude into a use case where it's not the right fit, I lose the relationship. If I'm honest about what works and what doesn't, I earn the right to expand. That's how you build a $10M account — one trusted recommendation at a time."

## STAR STORY 12: Managing Through Crisis / Protecting Revenue
**When she asks:** "Tell me about a time you managed a difficult situation" / "How do you handle churn risk?"

### Google — Pricing Crisis: Saving 10+ Major Accounts from Churning

**Situation:** In Q1 2017, Google's global GA360 commercialization team introduced significant pricing changes for APAC. This put approximately 10 of our largest and most important customers at risk of churning — Paytm, Myntra, Times Internet Group, Tokopedia, JD.ID, and others. Competitors were circling.

**Task:** Retain every at-risk customer while navigating the new pricing structure. Losing even one lighthouse account would weaken our market position across the region.

**Action:**
1. **Assessed the exposure immediately** — Mapped every at-risk account, quantified the price increase impact (some faced 250%+ increases), and prioritized by strategic value.
2. **Managed through partners and direct engagement** — Worked with reseller partners to communicate changes transparently. For key accounts like Myntra (3BN+ hits), I personally negotiated 2-year contract structures that provided pricing certainty in exchange for commitment.
3. **Turned defense into offense** — Used the renewal conversations to expand relationships. If a client was re-evaluating, I made sure the conversation included the full platform story — DoubleClick + GA360 + Cloud — so they saw broader value, not just a price increase.
4. **Kept the team focused** — This consumed the entire quarter. I managed the team's workload, ensuring we were systematic about risk mitigation rather than reactive.

**Result:** Every single at-risk client renewed. Zero churn. Continued to hit 108% quota attainment for the region despite the disruption. The pricing negotiation approach I used (multi-year commitments for price certainty) was similar to the EDP model I later sold at AWS.

**Relevance to Anthropic:**
"Pricing changes are inevitable as AI companies scale. I've navigated this before. The key is transparency, early engagement, and framing the conversation around value, not cost. For Anthropic's consumption model, I'd proactively build committed spend agreements that give customers certainty while protecting ARR."

## VERIFIED MANAGER & PEER QUOTES
*Use these if Catherine asks "What would your manager/colleagues say about you?"*

**Martin Bertilsson (Manager, Google GA360 APAC — 4 years):**
- "I regard Leroy as one of the crucial players in the overall team. As a sales professional he is very very strong. Constantly delivering on our core metrics (sales) whilst building up awareness internally and externally around data."
- "He owns his business. He starts with the goals he wants to achieve and then proactively works out a plan for how to get there and executes it with autonomy."
- "Leroy is Google and marketing data in SEA/India."

**Yiorgos Hadjiandrea (Manager, Google Platforms SEA):**
- "Problem solving, execution and leadership are why we hired Leroy as Head of In-Market SG, ID and MY. Leroy has hit the ground running and has done a fantastic job with limited guidance."
- "He is a proven leader, has great relationships and is well respected."

**Tony Keusgen (Country Director, Google Indonesia):**
- "It's the high level of engagement and a very strong bent toward driving outcomes which has underpinned what is now a huge and positive business opportunity."

**Swapnil Sinha (Peer, Google India):**
- "Leroy is a great sales leader who looks at the business strategically and is able to build things with a long term view and at the same time is there for all his clients when they need him."

**Pankaj Khushani (Peer, Google SEA):**
- "Leroy built the SEA GA360 business from scratch to over 40+ accounts. He has solid experience in building businesses in new territories which is a skill difficult to find."

**CT Corp Chairman (Chairul Tanjung, per AWS interview prep):**
- Backed Leroy's transformation mandate. Told the organisation: "If they keep this up, Leroy will get fed up and leave." Met with Leroy twice a week — trusted him as "my right hand man for all digital."

## STAR STORY 13: Digital Transformation of Legacy Business
**When she asks:** "Tell me about transforming a traditional business" / "How do you drive change in organisations resistant to it?" / "Tell me about a turnaround"

### CT Corp — Detik Network Digital Turnaround

**Situation:** CT Corp acquired Detik Network, Indonesia's largest digital publisher (20 years old). By the time I joined as President Director of CT Corp Digital, Detik was in decline — decreasing MAUs, falling impressions, high bounce rates, low engagement. The organisation was politically motivated with government links, deeply resistant to change, and believed they were still #1. The CPO and CTO pushed back on any intervention.

**Task:** Reverse the decline — grow MAUs, reduce bounce rates, increase engagement and monetisation — while navigating an organisation that didn't want to change.

**Action:**
1. **Deep-dived into the data** — Built a brand new customer analytics strategy to prove their metrics were underperforming. Implemented deeper analytics across all Detik properties. The data was undeniable — it broke through the "we're #1" narrative.
2. **Created the transformation plan** — Wrote a 12-page document and presented it to the Chairman and Board covering: shift to video monetisation, renegotiate ad rates, change ad servers, improve data quality, integrate data segments for monetisation, implement MVT testing, shift from reservation-based selling to direct programmatic.
3. **Restructured the sales team** — Detik had multiple properties (detikcom, beauty, CNBC, etc.) with everyone selling everything. I pivoted to industry-sector focused selling, created mini-pods (sales, SE, channel & customer success), built value-solution and industry-solution pitch decks focused on business outcomes.
4. **Fought through resistance** — Met with resistance at every level. Reluctance to take on extra work, misaligned incentives, fear of change. Broke down walls systematically over 11 months. The Chairman backed me — at one point told the team "if they keep this up, Leroy will get fed up and leave."

**Result:** Bounce rate reduced by half. Average CPM increased from a few cents to $8-15. MAUs doubled over two years. Sales revenue grew 2.5x. Built two $200-300M business units. The 11-month transformation plan became the playbook for digital across the group.

**Relevance to Anthropic:**
"Industries customers — banks, healthcare, manufacturing — are all legacy organisations resistant to change. I've done this at CT Corp with Detik. You need data to break through denial, a clear transformation roadmap, and the persistence to fight through organisational resistance. That's exactly what an Industries AE does when helping enterprises adopt Claude."

## STAR STORY 14: Customer Obsession / Fighting for the Customer
**When she asks:** "Tell me about going above and beyond for a customer" / "Tell me about a time you had to fight internally for the right outcome"

### Google — Paytm: Pushing Product Engineering to the CEO Level

**Situation:** In 2014-2015, I was expanding Google Analytics 360 into India — a mobile-first market. I won Paytm as our first major Indian client, competing against Adobe. The deal was end-to-end: sales, implementation, and customer success (the team was very lean).

**Task:** After implementation, I discovered that many of the GA360 use cases didn't work properly in India. The product was built for western desktop-first markets. Mobile screen behaviour, user behaviour tracking, and attribution all worked differently on mobile. Paytm was one of the largest mobile platforms in India — if we couldn't solve this, we'd lose the customer and the entire India market.

**Action:**
1. **Identified the gap on the ground** — Saw firsthand that mobile analytics implementation was fundamentally different from desktop. Screen behaviour, session tracking, attribution models — all needed to be rethought for mobile-first markets.
2. **Created user requirements documents** — Documented every gap between what the product offered and what mobile-first customers in India needed.
3. **Pushed up the chain** — Took the requirements to product engineering. Got significant pushback — US-based product managers believed desktop was still the primary focus. I escalated through multiple levels: up to Paul Muret (VP of Analytics), who reported to Sridhar Ramaswamy, who reported to Larry Page. Created new user requirements documents and fought for engineering resources.
4. **Partnered with the customer** — Worked directly with Arjun (VP Marketing & Analytics), who reported to Vijay Sharma (Paytm CEO). Kept the customer engaged and invested through the product improvement process.

**Result:** Retained Paytm and expanded from GA360 into additional products — they became a key lighthouse client for India. The mobile analytics improvements benefited every subsequent mobile-first customer across APAC. The relationship continued beyond one deal: when my contact Arjun moved to Tokopedia, we won that business too. First-year attainment hit 140%.

**Follow-up answers ready:**
- *"How high did you really escalate?"* — Three levels above me to a VP who reported to a SVP who reported to the CEO. Mobile-first analytics wasn't just a feature request — it was a market-defining requirement. I documented it rigorously and made the business case at each level.
- *"What was the pushback?"* — US product managers genuinely believed desktop was still the primary focus. I brought data from India and Southeast Asia showing mobile-first behaviour and the revenue at risk if we didn't adapt.

**Relevance to Anthropic:**
"At Anthropic, the Industries AE will encounter use cases the product team hasn't anticipated. When a bank needs Claude to work in a specific way for compliance or a healthcare company needs a particular safety feature, the AE needs to fight for the customer internally. I've done this — all the way up to the CEO level — and I'll do it for Anthropic's enterprise customers."

## STAR STORY 15: Building AI-Native Enterprise Infrastructure
**When she asks:** "Tell me about your AI experience" / "How did you build with AI?" / "What do you know about deploying AI in production?"

### Ringkas — Production AI Architecture at Enterprise Scale

**Situation:** When we built Ringkas, we didn't just add AI as a feature — we built the company as AI-native from day one. We needed to solve complex mortgage origination across 32 banks, each with different credit criteria, document requirements, and risk models. Manual processing took 6-8 weeks and cost banks $500-900 per mortgage.

**Task:** Build enterprise-grade AI infrastructure that could handle multi-bank mortgage origination, real-time credit assessment, and financial advisory — while meeting banking regulatory requirements (OJK, ISO 27001, penetration testing).

**Action:**
1. **Multi-agent AI architecture** — Built a hierarchical multi-agent system using LangGraph for orchestration. A central supervisor agent coordinates specialised sub-agents for loan origination, customer support, credit analysis, and KYC workflows. Each agent operates with domain expertise while sharing context through unified state management.
2. **Risa AI advisory product** — Deployed an AI financial advisor (risa.ringkas.homes) that helps customers understand their financial capacity, performs simulations, recommends products, and cross-sells — then onboards them into the mortgage workflow. Uses ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) cycles, vector-based knowledge bases across mortgage/loan/insurance domains, and LLM-as-Judge for quality evaluation.
3. **Enterprise security by design** — Deep audit trails, role-based access with configurable permissions, encrypted sensitive data, secret keys for each AI API feature. AWS WAF, IAM, Security Hub, KMS — the full stack. Passed bank penetration testing.
4. **Built the engineering team** — 25-person product & engineering team (19 engineers, 6 product) with depth from NAB, Pepper Advantage, Deloitte, Traveloka, GoTo. R&D office in Vietnam for cost efficiency. Achieved 99.95% SLA.

**Result:** Processing time reduced from 6-8 weeks to under 1 week. 71% reduction vs industry standard. 93% customer satisfaction (vs 87% benchmark for digital banking in Indonesia). 2,236 loans facilitated in first year of operations alone. 96% first-time home buyers served. 4.7% average interest rate — competitive even for Indonesia. Platform now handles 5-10K new registrations per month. Banks save $500-900 per mortgage originated through the platform.

**Follow-up answers ready:**
- *"Why OpenAI and not Claude?"* — We started building before Claude was available via Vertex AI in our region. The architecture is model-agnostic — the multi-agent orchestration layer (LangGraph) can work with any LLM. We're evaluating Claude for reasoning-intensive tasks like credit analysis where accuracy matters most. That's actually why I'm excited about this role — I know firsthand how these decisions get made.
- *"What's the hardest part of production AI?"* — Hallucination control in financial contexts. When your AI tells someone they can afford a $200K mortgage and they can't, that's a real-world problem. We built LLM-as-Judge evaluation across correctness, hallucination detection, and agent routing accuracy. That's the same challenge Anthropic's enterprise customers face.

**Relevance to Anthropic:**
"I'm not theoretical about AI. I've built and deployed multi-agent AI systems in production, in a regulated industry, at scale. I know what enterprise customers worry about — hallucination, security, audit trails, compliance. When I sit across from a bank CTO, I can speak from experience, not just a pitch deck. That's rare for an AE."

## STAR STORY 16: Capital Efficiency / Founder Mentality
**When she asks:** "How do you think about ROI?" / "Tell me about doing more with less" / "What's your approach to resource constraints?"

### CT Corp — Building a $300M Digital Business with Bare-Bone Resources

**Situation:** As President Director at CT Corp Digital, I was responsible for building digital capability across retail, media, and financial services — one of Indonesia's largest conglomerates. But this was a conglomerate, not a startup with VC money. Every dollar spent needed justification. The Chairman expected results, not excuses about budget.

**Task:** Build digital infrastructure across multiple business units — omnichannel retail, digital media, neo-banking — without the budget that Big 4 consultants would charge.

**Action:**
1. **Built instead of bought** — Developed platforms from scratch: OMS (order management), IMS (inventory management), logistics, ConnectPOS. The only platforms we purchased were Magento (e-commerce) and analytics. Everything else was built in-house or through our own development centre.
2. **Vietnam development centre** — Instead of hiring expensive Jakarta-based consultants or outsourcing to Accenture/Cognizant, I built a development centre in Vietnam. Great engineering talent at a fraction of the cost. Cloud-native architecture, no consultants, lean bare-bone resources.
3. **Designed the physical space** — Even built our office floor myself. Made our offices intentionally smaller than anyone else's — set the tone that this team was about output, not optics.
4. **200-person team, founder mentality** — Built and managed a 200-person team across digital, retail, media, and financial services. Ran it like a startup inside a conglomerate: OKRs, weekly cadence, data-driven decisions, real-time feedback. Hired directors, VPs, and also interns and students — coached at every level.

**Result:** 30% IRR with a 3-year payback period. Built two $200-300M business units. Created 100+ APIs across the ecosystem. The digital infrastructure I built became the backbone for CT Corp's digital transformation — omnichannel retail, Detik media turnaround, Bank Mega digital banking, loyalty/CRM platform.

**Relevance to Anthropic:**
"Anthropic ANZ is a founding team. There won't be unlimited budget or headcount. I've built $300M businesses with bare-bone resources and a founder mentality. I know how to prioritise ruthlessly, build what matters, and deliver ROI. That's the mindset a founding AE needs — treat every dollar of pipeline like it's your own money."
