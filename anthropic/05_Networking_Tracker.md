### Warm Intro Request (to mutual connection)

**Subject:** Quick ask - Anthropic introduction

```
Hi [Name],

Hope you're doing well. Quick ask - I'm exploring GTM roles at Anthropic
and wondered if you know anyone on their team.

Quick context: I've spent the last 3 years building production AI on
Claude (fintech, $700M mortgages, 32 banks) and have 18 years enterprise
GTM (Google, AWS).

If you have any connections there, I'd appreciate an intro. Happy to
send more context if helpful.

Thanks,
Leroy

### Cold Outreach (to Anthropic employee)

**Subject:** GTM at Anthropic - Claude customer & enterprise sales background

```
Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because I'm interested in GTM roles at Anthropic, and
I thought you might be a good person to talk to.

Quick background: I've spent the last 3 years building production AI on
Claude - I co-founded a mortgage platform that processes $700M annually
across 32 banks using Claude for credit analysis and document verification.
Before that, I led enterprise sales at Google ($4Bn portfolio) and AWS
($75M deals).

I'd love to learn more about how Anthropic is thinking about enterprise
GTM. Would you be open to a 15-minute call?

Either way, appreciate your time.

Leroy
