# Cover Letter - Anthropic

**[Customize the role title and hiring manager name before sending]**

Dear [Hiring Manager],

I'm applying for [Role Title] at Anthropic. I've spent 18 years selling enterprise software across APAC. The last three years, I've been building AI products on Claude. I want to bring that experience to help Anthropic win the enterprise market.

**Why I'm relevant:**

Most GTM leaders have either built AI products or sold to enterprises. I've done both.

At Ringkas, the fintech I co-founded, we built a multi-agent mortgage system on Claude. We chose Claude after evaluating all the major models - it was meaningfully better at reasoning through complex financial documents. That system now processes $700M in mortgages annually across 32 banks. I've shipped production AI, not just talked about it.

Before that, I spent 4 years at Google building the Analytics 360 business across APAC ($4Bn portfolio), then led AWS's Digital Native segment in Southeast Asia ($50M P&L, largest deals in the region). I know how to sell to enterprises, build partner ecosystems, and compete against entrenched incumbents.

**Why Anthropic:**

Three reasons. First, I've built on Claude and seen the quality difference firsthand. Second, Anthropic's approach to safety aligns with how I've had to build - in regulated industries, explainability and guardrails aren't optional. Third, enterprise AI adoption is just starting, and I want to help write the GTM playbook rather than follow someone else's.

**Why now:**

Ringkas is in a good place - strong management team, expanding to new markets. I've relocated to Sydney for family reasons (daughter starting school, aging parents). The combination makes this the right time to explore what's next. I'm open to APAC-based roles with global scope, or relocation for the right opportunity.

I'd welcome the chance to discuss how I can help Anthropic grow enterprise adoption in APAC and beyond.

Best regards,
Lee Roy Pinto
