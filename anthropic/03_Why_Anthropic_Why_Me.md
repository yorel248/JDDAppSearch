# Why Anthropic + Why Me

## The Pitch (30 seconds)

> "I've spent the last 3 years building production AI on Claude - a mortgage platform processing $700M annually across 32 banks. Before that, I sold enterprise software at Google and AWS for a decade, consistently hitting quota. I want to bring that combination - actually building with Claude plus enterprise sales execution - to help Anthropic win the enterprise market."

## Why Anthropic (Your Answer)

### 1. I've Built on Claude

"At Ringkas, we evaluated all the major foundation models for our credit analysis agents. We tested GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and several others.

Claude won. Not because of marketing - because of performance. For complex financial document reasoning, Claude was meaningfully better. When you're making lending decisions that affect people's lives, you need a model that can think through edge cases.

I've shipped production AI on Claude. I'm not just interested in Anthropic - I'm already a customer."

### 2. Safety Alignment

"I've built AI for regulated industries - banking, mortgages, lending. In that world, explainability isn't a nice-to-have. Regulators ask 'why did you reject this loan application?' You need to answer.

Anthropic's approach to Constitutional AI - building safety in rather than bolting it on - aligns with how I've had to build. Guardrails, bias detection, audit trails - I've implemented all of these.

Most AI companies treat safety as a PR problem. Anthropic treats it as an engineering problem. That's the right approach."

### 3. Timing

"Enterprise AI adoption is just starting. The playbook is being written right now.

I've done this before - at Google, I helped build the Analytics 360 enterprise business across APAC from early days. I know what it takes to go from 'interesting technology' to 'enterprise standard.'

I want to help write the GTM playbook for Claude, not follow someone else's."

## Addressing Potential Concerns

### "You've been a founder. Will you stay?"

"I've built a management team at Ringkas that's running day-to-day operations. The company is stable and expanding to new markets. On the personal side, I've relocated to Sydney for family reasons.

I'm not looking to start another company. I'm looking for a mission I believe in and a team I can contribute to. Anthropic's mission - responsible AI development - is something I genuinely care about.

And to be direct: I'm open to IC roles, not just leadership. I care about the work, not the title."

### "Why leave a company you founded?"

"Ringkas is in a good place - $11.5M raised, $700M in mortgages, 32 bank partners. I've done what I set out to do: prove that AI can transform mortgage lending.

The next chapter for Ringkas is geographic expansion and operational scaling. That's important work, but it's not what I'm best at. I'm best at building new things and selling complex enterprise deals.

Anthropic is at the stage where those skills matter most."

### "Sydney is far from SF."

"I've worked across time zones my entire career - Singapore, Sydney, Indonesia, India. I'm used to early mornings and late nights.

That said, I'm open to relocation for the right role. My priority is being part of the Anthropic mission. Location is secondary."

## The Ask

"I'm looking for a GTM role where I can help Anthropic grow enterprise adoption - whether that's in APAC, globally, or in a specific vertical like financial services.

I'm flexible on level - IC or manager, L6 or above. I care more about impact than title.

I'd love to learn more about how Anthropic is thinking about enterprise GTM and where I might fit."
