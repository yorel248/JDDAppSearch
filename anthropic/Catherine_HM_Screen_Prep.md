## KNOW YOUR INTERVIEWER

| | |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Catherine Donahoe |
| **Title** | International GTM Strategy & Ops, Anthropic (since May 2025) |
| **Reports to** | Chris Ciauri (MD International, ex-Google Cloud EMEA President) |
| **Background** | McKinsey (Engagement Manager, 2022-2025), Google (5 years, App Ad Sales/Measurement/gTech, 2015-2020), Stanford GSB MBA, University of Sydney |
| **Tenure at Anthropic** | ~8-9 months — she's building international GTM from scratch |
| **Your relationship** | You're one of her first hires. She needs to trust you to operate independently. |

**What she's evaluating (in order of priority):**
1. Can this person close complex enterprise deals? (deal competency)
2. Can this person build a market from zero? (founding AE capability)
3. Does this person understand AI / the product? (credibility)
4. Will I enjoy working with this person? (chemistry)

**Her interview style:**
- McKinsey-trained = expects structured answers. Use "There are three parts" or "Two things stood out" framing.
- She'll give you a question, then probe with follow-ups. Give the headline, let her pull detail.
- She values precision over enthusiasm. Numbers, not adjectives.
- She was at Google 2015-2020, you were there 2013-2017. There's overlap — use it lightly for rapport, don't dwell.
- She reports to Chris Ciauri (ex-Google Cloud). She understands how Google operated. Don't over-explain Google context.

## OPENER (20 seconds, then stop)

> "Thanks for taking the time, Catherine. I saw you were at Google as well — I was there from 2013 to 2017 building the Analytics business across ANZ and APAC. Looking forward to the conversation."

Then stop. Don't ramble. Let her set the agenda. She may ask "tell me about yourself" or jump straight to a question.

**If she asks "Tell me about yourself" (60 seconds max):**

> "Quick overview: 18 years in enterprise GTM. Four chapters.
>
> Google — first on the ground for Analytics 360 in Australia. Built it from 3 accounts to 110 deals across ANZ, India, and Southeast Asia. 46% of the APAC team's output.
>
> AWS — Head of Digital Natives in Southeast Asia. Closed the largest multi-year deal in APAC — a $75M enterprise discount program with Gojek.
>
> CT Corp — President Director running digital transformation across retail, media, and banking for Indonesia's third-largest conglomerate. 200-person team.
>
> Ringkas — co-founded an AI mortgage platform. 32 banks, $700M in annual origination, built on multi-agent AI architecture. Raised $11.5M.
>
> The thread across all four: building enterprise businesses from zero in new markets. That's what this role is."

Then stop. Let her ask the next question.

---

## QUESTION 1: DEAL DEEP DIVE
**She'll ask:** "Walk me through a complex deal" / "Tell me about your biggest win" / "Give me an example of enterprise selling"

### Answer: $75M AWS EDP — Gojek (2 minutes 15 seconds)

> "I'll walk you through the largest multi-year deal in APAC when I was at AWS.
>
> **Situation:** Gojek — Indonesia's largest super-app, ride-hailing, payments, food delivery — was running entirely on GCP. AWS wanted the account. It was the most competitive deal in Southeast Asia.
>
> **What I did — three things:**
>
> **First, found the wedge.** Engineering loved GCP, but the CFO was concerned about cost predictability at their growth rate. I identified that ML workloads — fraud detection, demand forecasting — were where SageMaker was materially better than GCP's tooling. I brought in AWS ML specialists to run a 4-week proof-of-concept.
>
> **Second, structured for the buyer.** I designed a 5-year enterprise discount program with committed spend that gave the CFO cost certainty. Engineering got flexibility to shift workloads underneath. The EDP addressed both stakeholders simultaneously.
>
> **Third, de-risked the decision.** Instead of asking them to migrate everything, I proposed starting ML workloads on AWS while keeping core infrastructure on GCP. Removed the all-or-nothing fear.
>
> **Result:** $75M five-year EDP. Largest multi-year deal in APAC. Gojek became a reference customer. The account grew to $50M P&L under my management."

### Her likely follow-ups and your answers:

**"Who was your champion?"**
> "VP Engineering who ran the ML team. He saw the SageMaker POC results and became the internal advocate. I gave him the data to sell it internally — benchmark results, cost projections, migration timeline."

**"How long was the cycle?"**
> "9 months from first meeting to signature."

**"What was the biggest objection?"**
> "Engineering team loyalty to GCP. We didn't fight it — we found the workloads where AWS was stronger and started there. Once the ML workloads were running, the conversation about broader migration happened naturally."

**"How did you manage multiple stakeholders?"**
> "Mapped the org in month one — CTO, CFO, VP Engineering, procurement. Each had a different concern. CTO cared about technical capability. CFO cared about cost predictability. VP Engineering cared about team productivity. I built separate value propositions for each and orchestrated the sequence — technical validation first, then financial structure, then executive sign-off."

---

## QUESTION 2: BUILDING FROM SCRATCH
**She'll ask:** "How would you build the Industries business?" / "Tell me about building something from zero" / "What's your approach to entering a new market?"

### Answer: Google Analytics 360 — ANZ to APAC (2 minutes 15 seconds)

> "I've built markets from zero three times. The most relevant one for this role is Google Analytics 360 in ANZ and APAC.
>
> **Situation:** 2014. GA360 had 3 direct accounts in Australia, zero resellers, and zero presence in the rest of APAC. Adobe owned the enterprise analytics market with a 5-year head start. I was the first on-the-ground hire after my manager.
>
> **My approach — lighthouse strategy, three steps:**
>
> **Step one: win the logos that matter.** I didn't try to win 50 accounts. I identified three that would validate us for the entire market — Telstra, Westpac, and Fairfax Media. I sold Westpac within my first week in-country. Built a TCO model showing GA360 plus BigQuery was 40% cheaper than Adobe over 3 years. Once those three were signed, every other conversation started with 'Westpac is already using this.'
>
> **Step two: build the channel.** Recruited and certified 21 resellers from zero across Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, and India. Trained them on competitive selling until one partner could close 5 deals independently.
>
> **Step three: replicate.** After proving ANZ, I relocated to Singapore and ran the same playbook across India and Southeast Asia. India went from zero to 31 clients in under a year.
>
> **Result:** 110 deals total — 46% of the entire APAC team's output. 100% or above quota every quarter from Q1 2014 through Q3 2016. Built the portfolio to $4B revenue under management. Promoted to Sales Manager II."

### The Anthropic bridge (say this immediately after):

> "For Anthropic Industries — same playbook. CommBank is already your lighthouse in banking. They've cut scam losses 50% using Claude. I'd leverage that reference to open Westpac, NAB, ANZ. Then identify one healthcare and one manufacturing lighthouse. Three marquee logos across industries would unlock the Australian market."

### Her likely follow-ups and your answers:

**"How did you prioritise which accounts to go after first?"**
> "Two criteria: logo value and speed to close. Westpac was the biggest brand in banking and they had an Adobe contract coming up for renewal. I timed the approach to their evaluation window. Logo value gets you the reference story. Speed gets you the momentum."

**"How long before you had traction?"**
> "First deal — Westpac — closed in week one. First 10 deals within 3 months. But the real inflection was at 6 months when we had enough lighthouse logos that inbound started coming in. The channel partners accelerated it further."

**"What would you do in the first 30 days here?"**
> "Three things. Map the top 50 Industries accounts in Australia — banks, healthcare, manufacturing — and rank by propensity. Identify which ones already have OpenAI pilots and their renewal timing. And get deep on the CommBank story — understand exactly what they built, the results, and who internally championed it. That's the asset I'd leverage for every subsequent conversation."

**"How do the three AE roles work together?"**
> "I'd want to align on account segmentation early. Clear handoff rules — if an account is primarily a bank but has a digital-native subsidiary, who owns it? In my experience, weekly pipeline reviews with all three AEs and a shared account map prevents territory friction. The three roles should be multiplying each other's wins, not competing."

---

## QUESTION 3: WHY ANTHROPIC / WHY LEAVE RINGKAS
**She'll ask:** "Why Anthropic?" / "You founded a company — why leave?" / "Can you work in a structured environment?"

These may come as one question or separately. Have both ready.

### "Why Anthropic?" (60 seconds)

> "Three reasons.
>
> First, I've built on Claude. At Ringkas we evaluated all the foundation models for our credit analysis and mortgage origination agents. Claude was better at reasoning through complex financial documents — edge cases, ambiguity, multi-step logic. I'm already a customer.
>
> Second, this is a founding AE role building from scratch. That's what I'm best at — I've done it at Google for ANZ, at AWS for digital natives in Southeast Asia, at Ringkas from zero. I don't want a comfortable territory. I want to build.
>
> Third, timing. Enterprise AI adoption in Australia is early. The playbook is being written now. I want to help write it, not follow someone else's."

### "Why leave Ringkas?" (60 seconds)

> "Ringkas is in a stable position — $11.5M raised, 32 bank partnerships, $700M in annual origination, strong management team running operations. We're expanding to the Middle East with local leadership.
>
> I built what I set out to build — proved that AI can transform mortgage lending in Southeast Asia. The company doesn't need me in the weeds anymore.
>
> On the personal side, I relocated back to Sydney. My daughter's starting school, my parents are getting older.
>
> What excites me about this role: it's a founding position, building from scratch, in AI, in a market I know. That's the intersection of everything I'm good at."

### If she probes "Can you work in structure after being a founder?"

> "I built structure at Ringkas — OKRs, reporting lines, decision rights, performance reviews twice a year. And I thrived at Google and AWS, which are highly structured. The founder experience taught me what I'm best at: building GTM and closing enterprise deals. I don't need to be the CEO to do that."

---

## QUESTION 4: WILDCARD
She may not get to a 4th question. But if she does, it's likely one of these:

### "How do you think about selling consumption-based AI?" (90 seconds)

> "I've sold consumption models at two companies.
>
> At AWS, I structured enterprise discount programs — committed annual spend with usage flexibility underneath. CFOs got a predictable number. Engineering got freedom to shift workloads. That's how I closed the $75M Gojek deal.
>
> At Ringkas, we charge per mortgage originated, not per API call. Banks only pay when they make money.
>
> The principle: enterprise buyers don't buy tokens. They buy outcomes. For Claude Industries, I'd lead with bounded use cases — document processing, customer service automation — where you can estimate token usage and show clear ROI. Start with committed spend agreements. Once they see value, expand."

### "Tell me about a competitive win" (90 seconds)

> "India's top 3 private banks — HDFC, Axis, ICICI — were all locked into Adobe Analytics. Nobody at Google had cracked Indian banking.
>
> I timed the approach to their contract renewals, built a TCO case showing GA360 plus BigQuery was 40% cheaper, and ran POCs at each bank during their evaluation window.
>
> Won all three. My performance review documented it: 'This is a first globally where we've managed to lock down banking where traditionally our competition is strong.' The playbook was adopted across APAC.
>
> For Anthropic, most enterprises already have OpenAI pilots. Same approach: time the evaluation, build the business case on quality and TCO, prove it with a head-to-head POC on their specific use case."

### "Tell me about a failure" (90 seconds)

> "At CT Corp, we launched Transmart's e-commerce platform to compete with Tokopedia and Shopee. We built the platform, integrated with 100+ physical stores, invested in customer acquisition.
>
> The failure: we underestimated the capital required. Tokopedia and Shopee were burning $100M-plus per year on acquisition. We couldn't match that.
>
> What I learned: don't fight incumbents on their strength. We pivoted to omnichannel — click-and-collect, same-day delivery from stores — which played to our retail footprint. That worked.
>
> I applied this at Ringkas: specifically chose mortgage infrastructure because there was no dominant player. I always ask now: 'What's our unfair advantage?'"

## YOUR QUESTIONS FOR CATHERINE (pick 2, skip the rest)

These are ranked. Ask #1 and #2 unless the conversation naturally opens a different one.

**1. "What does success look like at 6 months for this role?"**
- This tells you her expectations and how she measures performance. It also shows you think in terms of outcomes.

**2. "What's the biggest challenge you're facing in building the ANZ go-to-market right now?"**
- This gives you insight into what she's worried about. Her answer tells you what to emphasise in the take-home assignment.

**3. "How are you leveraging the CommBank story to open other industries?"**
- Shows you've done research. But only ask if it wasn't covered earlier.

**4. "How do the three AE roles — Industries, Digital Native, Startup — work together?"**
- Good for understanding the org. But lower priority than #1 and #2.

**When she answers, listen. Don't try to solve her problems in real time. Nod, take a mental note, and use it in the take-home assignment.**

---

## CLOSING STATEMENT (15 seconds, then stop)

> "I've built on Claude, I've sold enterprise software for 18 years, and I've built markets from zero three times. This is exactly the kind of challenge I'm looking for. I'd love to keep the conversation going."

Don't ask "what are the next steps?" — the recruiter handles that. End on a confident note and let her close.

## RED FLAGS — DON'T DO THIS

| Don't | Why | Do Instead |
|-------|-----|------------|
| Talk for more than 2.5 minutes on any answer | McKinsey-trained = values conciseness. She'll mentally check out. | Give the headline, let her pull detail with follow-ups. |
| Open with "Great question" | Filler. She knows it's a good question. | Just answer. |
| Say "just" / "I think" / "to be honest" / "basically" | Minimises you. "I think" signals uncertainty. | "In my experience" / "What I've found" / "To be direct" |
| Over-explain Google context | She was at Google. She knows how it works. | Reference briefly, move to the result. |
| Trash OpenAI | Unprofessional. | "Enterprises I've spoken to have concerns about governance and data practices." |
| Say "I love AI" or "AI is the future" | Vague enthusiasm. She's heard it from every candidate. | Be specific: "I built multi-agent systems on Claude for credit analysis." |
| Volunteer Ringkas problems | She might wonder if you're running away. | Frame as: "I built what I set out to build." |
| Ask about comp, title, or equity | Not this stage. | Wait for the recruiter or offer stage. |
| Try to fill silence | She may pause to think or take notes. | Wait. Silence is fine. |
| Mention "country manager" ambition | Too much too soon. Focus on the AE role. | If asked about growth: "I want to build something meaningful. The path will follow." |

## KNOW THE PRODUCT: HOW ANTHROPIC MAKES MONEY

**Don't volunteer this — but if she asks about consumption or pricing, you need to sound fluent.**

### Tokens in 10 seconds
A token is a chunk of text. 1 word = ~1.3 tokens. 1 million tokens = ~750,000 words. A 10-page document = ~3,500 tokens.

### How Anthropic charges
Charge per million tokens. **Input** (what you send) is cheap. **Output** (what Claude generates) costs more.

| Model | Input / 1M tokens | Output / 1M tokens | When to use |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Haiku 4.5 | $1 | $5 | Simple tasks, routing, classification |
| Sonnet 4.5 | $3 | $15 | Most enterprise work |
| Opus 4.5 | $5 | $25 | Complex reasoning, high-stakes |

### Three ways enterprises buy Claude

| Channel | How it works | Enterprise advantage |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| **API direct** | Dev team gets API key, pay-as-you-go | Fast to start, good for POCs |
| **Claude Enterprise** | Org-wide platform, annual contract, SSO, admin controls | Predictable cost, governance |
| **Cloud marketplace** (AWS Bedrock / Vertex AI) | Claude billed through existing AWS/GCP spend | No new procurement cycle — huge for banks |

**The Bedrock/Vertex angle is critical for Industries AE.** A bank already spending $10M/yr on AWS can allocate part of that to Claude without a new vendor approval. Removes procurement friction entirely.

### Cost levers (use in customer conversations)
- **Prompt caching** — Same large context sent repeatedly? 90% cheaper on reads after the first write.
- **Batch API** — Non-real-time jobs (overnight document processing)? 50% off.
- **Model routing** — 80% of tasks on Haiku ($1), 20% on Opus ($5). Smart architecture = lower bill.

### Maps directly to your AWS experience

| AWS concept | Anthropic equivalent |
|-------------|---------------------|
| On-demand compute | Pay-as-you-go API |
| Reserved instances | Annual committed spend |
| EDP | Enterprise agreement + volume discounts |
| Spot instances | Batch API (50% off) |
| CloudFront caching | Prompt caching (90% off) |

### The sales motion in one line
> Land with a bounded POC ($5-20K/mo) → prove ROI → expand use cases → convert to annual committed spend → grow token consumption as they embed deeper.

This is the same EDP motion you sold at AWS. Customer commits to $X/year, gets a discount, Anthropic gets revenue predictability. Tokens are the new compute hours.
