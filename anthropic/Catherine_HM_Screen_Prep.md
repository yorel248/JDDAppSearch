## Interviewer

Catherine Donahoe, International GTM Strategy & Ops at Anthropic (since May 2025). She reports to Chris Ciauri (Managing Director of International, ex-Google Cloud EMEA President, ex-Salesforce EVP EMEA — grew Salesforce EMEA from $200M to $3B). Prior to Anthropic she was an Engagement Manager at McKinsey (2022-2025), before that 5 years at Google in App Ad Sales, Measurement and gTech (2015-2020), and holds an MBA from Stanford GSB (2020-2022) as well as a connection to the University of Sydney.

She's approximately 8-9 months into Anthropic, building international GTM from scratch; this role (one of 3 founding senior AE positions in Australia — Industries, Digital Native, Startup) would be one of her first hires. She needs someone she can trust to operate independently from day one.

There is a shared Google overlap (I was at Google 2013-2017 building Analytics across ANZ and APAC; she was there 2015-2020 in App Ads). Use this lightly for rapport — she knows how Google operated; don't over-explain.

What she's evaluating (in order): 1/ can this person close complex enterprise deals (deal competency); 2/ can this person build a market from zero (founding AE capability); 3/ does this person understand AI and the product (credibility); 4/ will I enjoy working with this person (chemistry).

Her style is McKinsey-trained — she expects structured and analytical answers (i.e, "There are three parts" or "Two things stood out"), MECE frameworks, and concise responses. She will probe with follow-ups; give the headline and let her pull the detail. She values precision over enthusiasm — numbers, not adjectives.

---

## 30-Minute Flow

The interview should follow this approximate structure: 1/ Rapport and opener (~2 minutes); 2/ Question 1 — deal deep dive with follow-ups (~7 minutes); 3/ Question 2 — building from scratch with follow-ups (~7 minutes); 4/ Question 3 — why Anthropic, why leave Ringkas, or AI/consumption sales (~5 minutes); 5/ Question 4 — wildcard, she may skip this (~4 minutes); 6/ Questions for Catherine (~4 minutes); 7/ Close (~1 minute).

The rule is that no answer exceeds 2.5 minutes. If you hit 2 minutes, wrap up with the result and stop. Let her pull more detail through follow-ups.

---

## Opener

20 seconds, then stop:

"Thanks for taking the time, Catherine. I saw you were at Google as well — I was there from 2013 to 2017 building the Analytics business across ANZ and APAC. Looking forward to the conversation."

Then stop. Don't ramble. Let her set the agenda — she may ask "tell me about yourself" or jump straight to a question.

### If She Asks "Tell Me About Yourself"

60 seconds max. Structure it as four chapters with the thread at the end:

"Quick overview — 18 years in enterprise GTM across four chapters. 1/ Google, where I was the first on the ground for Analytics 360 in Australia, built it from 3 accounts to 110 deals across ANZ, India and Southeast Asia, 46% of the APAC team's output. 2/ AWS, Head of Digital Natives in Southeast Asia, closed the largest multi-year deal in APAC — a $75M enterprise discount program with Gojek. 3/ CT Corp, President Director running digital transformation across retail, media and banking for Indonesia's third-largest conglomerate, 200-person team. 4/ Ringkas, co-founded an AI mortgage platform, 32 banks, $700M in annual origination, built on multi-agent AI architecture, raised $11.5M. The thread across all four: building enterprise businesses from zero in new markets. That's what this role is."

Then stop. Let her ask the next question.

---

## Question 1: Deal Deep Dive

She'll ask something along the lines of "Walk me through a complex deal" or "Tell me about your biggest win" or "Give me an example of enterprise selling." This is almost guaranteed as the opening question for a sales HM screen — she needs to see you can close.

### Answer: $75M AWS EDP — Gojek (2 minutes 15 seconds)

"I'll walk you through the largest multi-year deal in APAC when I was at AWS.

Gojek — Indonesia's largest super-app, ride-hailing, payments, food delivery — was running entirely on GCP. AWS wanted the account and it was the most competitive deal in Southeast Asia. I was 6 months into the role and this was the anchor deal for the country.

What I did — three things. 1/ Found the wedge. Engineering loved GCP, but the CFO was concerned about cost predictability at their growth rate. I identified that ML workloads (fraud detection, demand forecasting) were where SageMaker was materially better than GCP's tooling. I brought in AWS ML specialists to run a 4-week proof-of-concept. 2/ Structured for the buyer. I designed a 5-year enterprise discount program with committed spend that gave the CFO cost certainty; engineering got flexibility to shift workloads underneath. The EDP addressed both stakeholders simultaneously. 3/ De-risked the decision. Instead of asking them to migrate everything, I proposed starting ML workloads on AWS while keeping core infrastructure on GCP — removed the all-or-nothing fear.

Result: $75M five-year EDP, largest multi-year deal in APAC. Gojek became a reference customer and the account grew to $50M P&L under my management."

### Follow-Ups

If she asks "Who was your champion?" — "VP Engineering who ran the ML team. He saw the SageMaker POC results and became the internal advocate. I gave him the data to sell it internally — benchmark results, cost projections, migration timeline."

If she asks "How long was the cycle?" — "9 months from first meeting to signature."

If she asks "What was the biggest objection?" — "Engineering team loyalty to GCP. We didn't fight it — we found the workloads where AWS was stronger and started there. Once the ML workloads were running, the conversation about broader migration happened naturally."

If she asks "How did you manage multiple stakeholders?" — "Mapped the org in month one — CTO, CFO, VP Engineering, procurement. Each had a different concern (CTO = technical capability, CFO = cost predictability, VP Engineering = team productivity). I built separate value propositions for each and orchestrated the sequence — technical validation first, then financial structure, then executive sign-off."

---

## Question 2: Building From Scratch

She'll ask something along the lines of "How would you build the Industries business?" or "Tell me about building something from zero" or "What's your approach to entering a new market?" This is critical — it's a founding AE role and she needs to see you've done 0 to 1 before.

### Answer: Google Analytics 360 — ANZ to APAC (2 minutes 15 seconds)

"I've built markets from zero three times. The most relevant one for this role is Google Analytics 360 in ANZ and APAC.

In 2014, GA360 had 3 direct accounts in Australia, zero resellers, and zero presence in the rest of APAC. Adobe owned the enterprise analytics market with a 5+ year head start. I was the first on-the-ground hire after my manager.

My approach was a lighthouse strategy in three steps. 1/ Win the logos that matter. I didn't try to win 50 accounts — I identified three that would validate us for the entire market: Telstra, Westpac and Fairfax Media. I sold Westpac within my first week in-country; built a TCO model showing GA360 plus BigQuery was 40% cheaper than Adobe over 3 years. Once those three were signed, every other conversation started with 'Westpac is already using this.' 2/ Build the channel. Recruited and certified 21 resellers from zero across Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia and India; trained them on competitive selling until one partner could close 5 deals independently. 3/ Replicate. After proving ANZ, I relocated to Singapore and ran the same playbook across India and Southeast Asia. India went from zero to 31 clients in under a year.

Result: 110 deals total — 46% of the entire APAC team's output. 100% or above quota every quarter from Q1 2014 through Q3 2016 (specific attainments: 101%, 103%, 102%, 108%). Built the portfolio to $4B revenue under management. Promoted to Sales Manager II."

### The Anthropic Bridge

Say this immediately after the result — it connects the story to why it matters for this role:

"For Anthropic Industries — same playbook. CommBank is already your lighthouse in banking; they've cut scam losses 50% using Claude. I'd leverage that reference to open Westpac, NAB, ANZ. Then identify one healthcare and one manufacturing lighthouse. Three marquee logos across industries would unlock the Australian market."

### Follow-Ups

If she asks "How did you prioritise which accounts to go after first?" — "Two criteria: logo value and speed to close. Westpac was the biggest brand in banking and they had an Adobe contract coming up for renewal. I timed the approach to their evaluation window. Logo value gets you the reference story; speed gets you the momentum."

If she asks "How long before you had traction?" — "First deal closed in week one (Westpac). First 10 deals within 3 months. The real inflection was at 6 months when we had enough lighthouse logos that inbound started coming in. The channel partners accelerated it further."

If she asks "What would you do in the first 30 days here?" — "Three things. Map the top 50 Industries accounts in Australia (banks, healthcare, manufacturing) and rank by propensity. Identify which ones already have OpenAI pilots and their renewal timing. And get deep on the CommBank story — understand exactly what they built, the results, and who internally championed it. That's the asset I'd leverage for every subsequent conversation."

If she asks "How do the three AE roles work together?" — "I'd want to align on account segmentation early — clear handoff rules so that if an account is primarily a bank but has a digital-native subsidiary, there's no ambiguity on ownership. In my experience, weekly pipeline reviews with all three AEs and a shared account map prevents territory friction. The three roles should be multiplying each other's wins, not competing."

---

## Question 3: Why Anthropic / Why Leave Ringkas

These may come as one question or separately. Have both ready; she may ask one and then probe on the other.

### "Why Anthropic?" (60 seconds)

"Three reasons. 1/ I've built on Claude. At Ringkas we evaluated all the foundation models for our credit analysis and mortgage origination agents — Claude was better at reasoning through complex financial documents, edge cases, ambiguity, multi-step logic. I'm already a customer. 2/ This is a founding AE role building from scratch, and that's what I'm best at — I've done it at Google for ANZ, at AWS for digital natives in Southeast Asia, at Ringkas from zero. I don't want a comfortable territory; I want to build. 3/ Timing. Enterprise AI adoption in Australia is early. The playbook is being written now. I want to help write it, not follow someone else's."

### "Why Leave Ringkas?" (60 seconds)

"Ringkas is in a stable position — $11.5M raised, 32 bank partnerships, $700M in annual origination, strong management team running operations. We're expanding to the Middle East with local leadership. I built what I set out to build — proved that AI can transform mortgage lending in Southeast Asia. The company doesn't need me in the weeds anymore. On the personal side, I relocated back to Sydney; my daughter's starting school, my parents are getting older. What excites me about this role: it's a founding position, building from scratch, in AI, in a market I know. That's the intersection of everything I'm good at."

### If She Probes "Can You Work in Structure After Being a Founder?"

"I built structure at Ringkas — OKRs, reporting lines, decision rights, performance reviews twice a year. And I thrived at Google and AWS, which are highly structured environments. The founder experience taught me what I'm best at: building GTM and closing enterprise deals. I don't need to be the CEO to do that."

---

## Question 4: Wildcard

She may not get to a 4th question; but if she does, it's likely one of these three. Have all three loaded — pick the one that matches her question.

### "How do you think about selling consumption-based AI?" (90 seconds)

"I've sold consumption models at two companies. At AWS, I structured enterprise discount programs — committed annual spend with usage flexibility underneath. CFOs got a predictable number; engineering got freedom to shift workloads. That's how I closed the $75M Gojek deal. At Ringkas, we charge per mortgage originated, not per API call — banks only pay when they make money. The principle: enterprise buyers don't buy tokens, they buy outcomes. For Claude Industries, I'd lead with bounded use cases (document processing, customer service automation) where you can estimate token usage and show clear ROI. Start with committed spend agreements; once they see value, expand."

### "Tell me about a competitive win" (90 seconds)

"India's top 3 private banks — HDFC, Axis, ICICI — were all locked into Adobe Analytics. Nobody at Google had cracked Indian banking. I timed the approach to their contract renewals, built a TCO case showing GA360 plus BigQuery was 40% cheaper, and ran POCs at each bank during their evaluation window. Won all three. My performance review documented it: 'This is a first globally where we've managed to lock down banking where traditionally our competition is strong.' The playbook was adopted across APAC. For Anthropic, most enterprises already have OpenAI pilots — same approach: time the evaluation, build the business case on quality and TCO, prove it with a head-to-head POC on their specific use case."

### "Tell me about a failure" (90 seconds)

"At CT Corp, we launched Transmart's e-commerce platform to compete with Tokopedia and Shopee. We built the platform, integrated with 100+ physical stores, invested in customer acquisition. The failure: we underestimated the capital required — Tokopedia and Shopee were burning $100M+ per year on acquisition and we couldn't match that with a conglomerate's budget cycle. What I learned: don't fight incumbents on their strength. We pivoted to omnichannel (click-and-collect, same-day delivery from stores) which played to our retail footprint, and that worked. I applied this at Ringkas — specifically chose mortgage infrastructure because there was no dominant player. I always ask now: 'What's our unfair advantage?'"

## Questions for Catherine

Pick 2 from the list below; skip the rest. Ask #1 and #2 unless the conversation naturally opens a different one.

1/ "What does success look like at 6 months for this role?" — this tells you her expectations and how she measures performance; it also shows you think in terms of outcomes.

2/ "What's the biggest challenge you're facing in building the ANZ go-to-market right now?" — this gives you insight into what she's worried about, and her answer informs what to emphasise in the take-home assignment.

3/ "How are you leveraging the CommBank story to open other industries?" — shows you've done research, but only ask if it wasn't already covered earlier in the conversation.

4/ "How do the three AE roles (Industries, Digital Native, Startup) work together?" — good for understanding the org, but lower priority than #1 and #2.

When she answers, listen. Don't try to solve her problems in real time; take a mental note and use it in the take-home assignment.

---

## Close

15 seconds, then stop:

"I've built on Claude, I've sold enterprise software for 18 years, and I've built markets from zero three times. This is exactly the kind of challenge I'm looking for. I'd love to keep the conversation going."

Don't ask "what are the next steps?" — the recruiter handles that. End on a confident note and let her close the call.

---

## Things to Avoid

1/ Don't talk for more than 2.5 minutes on any answer — McKinsey-trained interviewers value conciseness; she'll mentally check out. Give the headline and let her pull detail with follow-ups.

2/ Don't open with "Great question" — it's filler. She knows it's a good question. Just answer.

3/ Avoid the words "just", "I think", "to be honest", "basically" — they minimise you. Use instead: "In my experience", "What I've found", "To be direct."

4/ Don't over-explain Google context — she was at Google. She knows how it works. Reference briefly and move to the result.

5/ Don't trash OpenAI — it's unprofessional. If it comes up: "Enterprises I've spoken to have concerns about governance and data practices."

6/ Don't say "I love AI" or "AI is the future" — vague enthusiasm, she's heard it from every candidate. Be specific: "I built multi-agent systems for credit analysis in production."

7/ Don't volunteer Ringkas problems — she might wonder if you're running away. Frame as: "I built what I set out to build."

8/ Don't ask about comp, title or equity — not at this stage; wait for the recruiter or offer stage.

9/ Don't try to fill silence — she may pause to think or take notes. Silence is fine.

10/ Don't mention "country manager" ambition — too much too soon. Focus on the AE role. If asked about growth: "I want to build something meaningful. The path will follow."

## Pre-Call Checklist

30 minutes before the call: 1/ read this document once, top to bottom; 2/ say the opener out loud once; 3/ say the "Tell me about yourself" answer out loud and time it (must be under 60 seconds); 4/ say the Gojek deal answer out loud and time it (must be under 2:15); 5/ say the Google ANZ market build answer out loud and time it (must be under 2:15); 6/ say "Why Anthropic" out loud and time it (must be under 60 seconds); 7/ have a glass of water ready; 8/ close all tabs except the video call; 9/ phone on silent, face down; 10/ notebook open with Catherine's name and today's date (even on video calls — it signals preparation).

---

## After the Call

Within 1 hour: 1/ write down every question she asked (exact wording if possible); 2/ write down her answers to your questions — these inform the take-home assignment; 3/ note anything that surprised you or felt off; 4/ send a brief thank-you via the recruiter (not directly unless she gives you her email): "Thanks for the conversation. Particularly appreciated hearing about [specific thing she said]. Looking forward to the next step."

---

## Cheat Sheet

Keep on screen or print — key numbers and answer headlines:

Opener: "Thanks for taking the time, Catherine. Google overlap. Looking forward."

Deal: $75M Gojek EDP. Wedge = SageMaker ML. CFO = cost certainty. De-risked = hybrid approach. 9 months cycle. VP Eng champion.

Build: Google ANZ to APAC. 3 accounts to 110 deals, 46% of APAC. Lighthouse strategy (Westpac in week 1) then channel (21 resellers) then replicate. Bridge: "CommBank is your lighthouse. I'd open Westpac, NAB, ANZ."

Why: Built on Claude. Founding AE = what I'm best at. Timing.

Leave: Built what I set out to build. Sydney for family. Want to build, not maintain.

Consumption: EDP = committed spend + usage flex. Outcomes not tokens. Bounded use cases then committed spend then expand.

Competitive: India banks 3/3. Timed renewals. TCO + POC. Same for displacing OpenAI.

My Qs: "Success at 6 months?" + "Biggest ANZ challenge?"

Close: "Built on Claude. 18 years. Zero three times. This is the challenge I'm looking for."

Key numbers: $75M (Gojek), 110 deals (Google), 46% of APAC, $4B portfolio, 32 banks, $700M origination, $11.5M raised, 21 resellers, 31 India clients, 200-person team (CT Corp), 96% first-time buyers (Ringkas impact).

## Product Knowledge: How Anthropic Makes Money

Don't volunteer this section during the interview — but if she asks about consumption, pricing or tokenisation, you need to sound fluent. This maps directly to the EDP/consumption model you already sold at AWS.

### Tokens

A token is a chunk of text; 1 word is approximately 1.3 tokens. 1 million tokens equals roughly 750,000 words; a 10-page document is approximately 3,500 tokens. Anthropic charges per million tokens, separately for input (what you send to Claude) and output (what Claude generates back). Output is always more expensive because the model is generating, not just reading.

### Pricing

Current Claude 4.5 series: 1/ Haiku 4.5 at $1 input / $5 output per million tokens (fastest, use for simple tasks, routing, classification); 2/ Sonnet 4.5 at $3 input / $15 output per million tokens (balanced — this is what most enterprise work runs on); 3/ Opus 4.5 at $5 input / $25 output per million tokens (most capable — complex reasoning, high-stakes use cases).

### How Enterprises Buy Claude

There are three main channels: 1/ API direct, where a dev team gets an API key and pays as they go — fast to start, good for POCs; 2/ Claude Enterprise, which is an org-wide platform with annual contract, SSO, admin controls — predictable cost and governance; 3/ Cloud marketplace (AWS Bedrock or Google Vertex AI), where Claude is billed through the enterprise's existing AWS or GCP spend — no new procurement cycle required.

The Bedrock/Vertex angle is critical for Industries AE. A bank already spending $10M/yr on AWS can allocate part of that committed spend to Claude without a new vendor approval process. This removes procurement friction entirely, which is a major advantage in regulated industries where new vendor onboarding can take 6-12 months.

### Cost Levers

There are three main levers for enterprise customers to manage costs: 1/ Prompt caching — if the same large context is sent repeatedly (i.e, a 100-page compliance manual as a system prompt), cached reads cost 90% less after the first write; 2/ Batch API — for non-real-time workloads such as overnight document processing, there is a 50% discount on both input and output tokens; 3/ Model routing — a well-architected system routes 80% of tasks to Haiku ($1/MTok input) and reserves Opus ($5/MTok input) for the 20% that require complex reasoning. This can reduce overall costs by 60-70%.

### Maps to AWS

The pricing model maps directly to what you sold at AWS: 1/ on-demand compute = pay-as-you-go API; 2/ reserved instances = annual committed spend; 3/ EDP = enterprise agreement with volume discounts; 4/ spot instances = Batch API (50% off for non-real-time); 5/ CloudFront caching = prompt caching (90% off for repeated context).

### Sales Motion

The consumption growth motion in one line: land with a bounded POC ($5-20K/mo) in a single use case, prove ROI, expand to additional use cases and teams, convert to annual committed spend agreement, then grow token consumption as the customer embeds Claude deeper into their workflows. This is the same EDP motion you sold at AWS — customer commits to $X/year, gets a discount, Anthropic gets revenue predictability. Tokens are the new compute hours.
