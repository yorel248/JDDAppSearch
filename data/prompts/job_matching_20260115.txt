Analyze job matches based on the user's profile and the job listings found.

Input files:
1. User Profile: ./data/profile_extracted.json
2. Job Listings: ./data/job_search_results.json

For each job, calculate a match score (0-100) based on:
- Skill alignment (40%): How well do the candidate's skills match requirements?
- Experience match (30%): Years of experience and relevance of past roles
- Education fit (15%): Does education meet requirements?
- Location/Remote preference (15%): Location compatibility

Additional scoring factors:
- Boost score if company is in preferred industry (+5)
- Boost if salary range matches expectations (+5)
- Penalty if overqualified (-10)
- Penalty if significantly underqualified (-20)

Create a shortlist of top 15 jobs with:
1. Match score and detailed breakdown
2. Strengths (why you're a good fit)
3. Gaps (what you might be missing)
4. Why apply (compelling reasons)
5. Application strategy tips
